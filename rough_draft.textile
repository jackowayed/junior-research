Wilde's Mocking of the English Aristocracy as a Satirization of the English Treatment of Ireland
Oscar Wilde, a self-professed socialist who wrote _The Soul of Man Under Socialism_, did not truly believe in socialism.

Throughout _The Importance of Being Earnest_, Oscar Wilde mocks the English upper class, creating ostensible socialist themes. The play features two main heroes, foils for each other; Algernon, who resides in London, sojourns in the country under the pretense of visiting his friend Bunbury when he wishes to avoid engagements, and his friend Jack, a country-dweller, claims to visit his brother Ernest in London when he wishes to escape his need to "adopt a high moral tone on all subjects" (Wilde 6). One particular instance of Wilde mocking the upper class occurs early in the drama when Algernon states, "if the lower orders don't set us a good example, what on earth is the use of them? They seem, as a class, to have absolutely no sense of moral responsibility" (2). Despite the fact that high society in this time period placed considerable emphasis on propriety (Holland 5), Algernon feels that the oppressed, struggling lower class should set the example for the aristocracy that generally prides itself on respectability. This ironic statement shows Wilde's belief in the superiority of the working class, as even his upper-class characters believe that they should look up to the "lower orders" as an example. This demonstrates the upper class's hyporcisy; the aristocrats claimed to stress morality, yet in reality they completely lacked it, as demonstrated by Algernon's and Jack's need to Bunbury. Algernon's ridiculous disgust with the lower class conversely leads the audience to feel comparable disgust for the upper class of which he is a member, demonstrating the hypocrisy and deception of the English upper clas and as a result supporting the socialist belief that the working class should possess the power and wealth that it produces through strenuous toil. Another instance of Wilde ridiculing the rich occurs when Lady Bracknell insults Algernon for being an orphan, delcaring, "To lose one parent ... may be regarded as a misfortune; to lose both looks like carelessness" (14). This shows the rich's complete callousness towards those with poor fortune, reflecting their apathy to those who lack economic forture. By making the instance of insensitivity so extreme, Wilde bolsters the apparent socialist themes, intensifying the satire of the English rich. By portraying the aristocrats in this play as devoid of morality and sympathy, Wilde harshly criticizes them, forging strong socialist themes in the process.
Though the play contains a dichotomy between the country and the city, Wilde demonstrates no favoritism with his ridicule, demonstrating the he is mocking the English upper-class as a whole, not just dwellers of one realm. Every major character in the play possesses a foil from the other world. These sets of counterparts&mdash;Algernon and Jack, Cecily and Gwendolen, and Lady Bracknell and Miss Prism&mdash;mirror each other so well that one can easily forget who hails from which land. Algernon and Jack both Bunbury (6) and each bickers profusely with the other (2-8). They Bunbury so that they can shirk their responsibilities and engagements, representing the class as a whole shirking its responsibilities to support the destitute and the menial laborers necessary for their prosperity. The fact that both partake in this action shows the balance between the Londoners and the country-dwellers in the play. Wilde further creates socialist themes and equality between Londoners and countryfolk by having those from both London and the country say lines that mock the rich. In one such instance, Algernon, from the city, states, "It is awfully hard work doing nothing" (17). In a time when the poor toiled in factories all day, Algernon finds it hard work to deprive himself of the luxuries&mdash;theatres, clubs, and other forms of leisure&mdash;to which he has become accustomed. Jack, Algernon's foil, equally strongly shows a major flaw with the upper class, the lack of honesty and true propriety when he declares, "Gwendolen, it is a terrible thing for a man to find out suddenly that all his life has has been speaking nothing but the thruth. Can you forgive me?" (54). This statement directly opposes what one would generally expect to hear, as he states his deep contrition for the horrible offense of telling the truth, when most, including those of the society of the time theoretically, value honesty as a virtue rather than a crime.
